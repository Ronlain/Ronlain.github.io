                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>Leap into a mysterious ancient temple as a treasure loving snake! Challenge your puzzle solving talents and test your dexterity with this new 
                    puzzle-platformer.</p>
                <p>In Leap A Head the player is a snake that jumps from block to block, collecting coins and overcoming obstacles to reach the end of the level. 
                    Players are challenged to solve each level in the fewest amount of leaps while also collecting all the coins in order to achieve the maximum score.</p>
                <p>Leap A Head was developed by a team of students from the MassDiGI Summer Innovation Program 2017 and has continued development through Becker 
                    College's "Live Studio" course. </p>
                <p>I initially came onto Leap A Head to do prototyping work in the spring of 2018, working along side a the launch team as theywere putting the finishing 
                    touches on the game before it went to Google Play and the iOS app store. The rapid-development prototyping team was the first of its kind at MassDiGI 
                    and was tasked with creating a process by which we could brainstorm, evaluate, and develop proofs of concepts for mechanics.The following fall I was 
                    put on the live ops team tasked with taking the data from the launch in the spring and using it to make design decisions for the game, focusing on 
                    improving our retention and level completion rate metrics. In the spring of 2019 I became the lead programmer of the live ops team still tasked with 
                    data driven design to improve our analytics.</p>
                <h2>My Contributions</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Assisted in the creation of a process by which mechanics are brainstormed, evaluated, and tested for viability</li>
                    <li>Implementation of features such as the <a href=https://gfycat.com/VelvetyThinBorer>Gate and Key</a> and 
                        <a href=https://gfycat.com/GiddyInfatuatedHairstreakbutterfly>heartbreak animation</a></li>
                    <li>Implemented A/B Testing via the GameAnalytics SDK to test various features</li>
                    <li>Weekly builds on iOS and Android</li>
                </ul>
