                <h2>Project Summary</h2>
                <p>Inner Demon began development in the Summer of 2019 through an internship provided by MassDiGI. A team of 5 was selected via an application process and then
				put to work on a project that was intended to be entered into student game competitions.</p>
                <p>Inner Demon is designed as a 2.5D puzzle platformer that incorportates both platforming and combat in a unique way while also providing the player with
				high quality visuals.</p>
                <p>I began work on Inner Demon in the Summer of 2019 as part of the previously mentioned MassDiGI internship. We had many ideas for games based on games that
				had won student game competitions in the past, but in the end we decided that Inner Demon was going to be the easiest to work on while still giving us the best
				chances of performing well at these competitions. My work on Inner Demon spanned the 12 weeek period in the Summer and then continued into the fall semester as the 
				game was brought into Becker College's Live Studio course to be worked on. There I became the lead programmer on the project.</p>
